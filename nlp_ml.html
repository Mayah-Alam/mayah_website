        <p>
            I learned these skills in my Information Retrieval class and Artifical Intelligence class at the University of Michigan.
            All of these projects are coded in Python.

        <h5>Joke Detection</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: March 2024<br>
            About: I used a <span class="key">naive bayes machine learning (ML) algorithm</span> to categorize sentences 
            into jokes and non-jokes. We were given two sets of training data. Jokes and non-jokes provided by the 
            instructional team and output from AI after prompting to tell us a joke. This model did not do well becuase even
            humans don't know what makes a joke funny. This would be an interesting project to go back to. <br>

        <h5>Vector Space Model</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: February 2024<br>
            About: I created a vector space model with document weighting tfc or nfc 
            and query weighting tfx or bfx. All four combinations of weighting are valid.
            First I removed SGML tags, stemmed, and used my tokenizer below.
            This project's purpose was to compare and learn about different weighting schemes. <br>

            Team size: 1<br>
            When: January 2024<br>
            About: I trained an <span class="key">unigram and bigram natural language processing (NLP) model</span> to
            predict if unseen sentences are English, French, or Italian. First I tokenized my text using my tokenizer below.
            My algorithm is 99.67% accurate! <br>

            Team size: 1<br>
            When: January 2024<br>
            About: I created a <span class="key">Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Algorithm</span> for the cranfield
            documents. I first tokenized the test using my Tokenizer shown below. <br>

        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: January 2024<br>
            About: I built a <span class="key">tokenizer to find unique tokens</span> in the Cranfield documents.
            My tokenizer handles stop words, punctuation, acronyms, numbers, special characters, apostrophes, and date formatting.
            Most people don't realize how many ways there are to format dates! In later projects 
            my professor providing code for stemming to improve our accuracy of Machine Learning algorithms. <br>

        <h5>Image Classifier</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: October-November 2023<br>
            About: I coded a <span class="key">fully connected neural network and convolutional neural network using PyTorch</span>
            to classify images into 10 categories. The training data consisted of 6,000 images per class and the testing data had 50,000 images.
            Given a partially completed neural network, I determined how many input features were given to the first layer and how many output features there were.
