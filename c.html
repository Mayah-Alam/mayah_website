    <div class="about">
        <p>
            For the first two years at the University of Michgian all of my coding classes were in C++.
            I have an extensive knowledge of data structures and Object Orientated Programming (OOP).

        <h5>LC2K Pipeline Simulator</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: November 2022-December 2022<br>
            About: I used C to simulate a computer reading tasks in <span class="key">binary.</span>
            This program can handle the following instructions: add, nor, lw (load word), sw (save word), beq (conditional branch),
            jalr (jump), and halt. This machine also has a <span class="key">cache, processor, and memory simulated with C</span> 
            data structs and methods. I utilized <span class="key">data forwarding and branch prediction</span> to resolve hazards
            and speed up the program. I designed my own <span class="key">test cases in machine code for this project.</span><br>

        <h5>Treasure Hunt Game</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 1<br>
            When: Janurary 2022<br>
            About: I built a <span class="key">text based game in C++</span> where pirates are searching for treasure on varied terrain.
            My program uses conditionals to identify land, water, obstacles and treasure terrain. 
            If the ship is on water the Captain searches and if on land the First Mate searches. 
            The Captain and First Mate are assigned a <span class="key">breadth first or depth first search strategy based on user input.</span> 
            Once the treasure is found the program outputs a direct path from the starting point to the treasure. 
            This project utilizes <span class="key">object-oriented programming (OOP) structures stack and queue.</span> 
            I was given a spec for the project but had full freedom in how to create classes and approach the problem.
            <span class="key">I designed my own test cases and treasure maps for this project</span>

            Team size: 2<br>
            When: October 2021<br>
            About: My partner and I created a program that simulates a game of <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/special/orientation-edition/learning-how-to-play-euchre-instructions-from-a-non-michigander/">Euchre</a>
            supporting both and <span class="key">AI and human player.</span> We utilized derived classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions.
            This is a notoriously hard coding project for Computer Science majors at the University of Michigan. <br>
