        <p>
            All of my upper level computer science classes my senior year were taught in Python.
            I coded all of my <a href="nlp_ml.hmtl">natural language processing, machine learning, and AI projects</a> in python.
            I also used Python in all of my <a href="web.html">web applications</a> for API integration, authentication, templates, and more.<br>
            On this page all my other python projects are listed.

        <h5>March Madness Bracket Generator</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 5<br>
            When: February-April 2024<br>
            About: Our team created a bracket generator for March Madness for our semester long project.
            We coded a <span class="key">web crawler</span> to scrape NCAA data from the ESPN website. 
            Then we created a <span class="key">custom score metric</span> using win percentage and SOS (Strength of schedule).
            Then <span class="key">I personally designed algorithms in Python to predict the winners</span> of each game in every round using seeding 
            history and our metric. <span class="key">I incorporated randomness</span> so we could generate a variety of brackets
            which averaged a precision of 34% for the final four over 50 brackets (which is better than the average human).
            We quantified and visualized our results in the following poster as well as a written report. <br>

        <h5>Mapreduce Distributed System</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 3<br>
            When October-November 2023: <br>
            About: We simulated a <span class="key">distributed systems</span> environment using <span class="key"></span>TCP and UDP threading and sockets.
             We executed the Michigan <span class="key">Hadoop algorithm</span> called Madoop. In order to properly simulate a distributed environment 
             we had to create a <span class="key">layer of abstraction.</span> Our Manager class had to assign jobs to remote Workers and reassign tasks if 
             the Worker was <q>offline</q>. Each Worker had to complete its given task and send <span class="key">heartbeats using UDP</span> to the Manager. There was no direct connection
            between the Manager and workers.<br>
