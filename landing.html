        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Michigan with honors earning a B.S. in Computer Science with a sustainability minor in May 2024.
            I code because I love finding creative solutions to problems. I want to be able to help others and continue to grow my skill set. 
            What sets me apart is that I am very social and enjoy meeting new people. Starting in June, I will be a Software Implementation Consultant
            on the Product Team at Manhattan Associates. Right now I am a math and computer science tutor at Varsity Tutors helping kids across the country. 
            Both of these jobs allow me to combine my passions for people and tech. 
            I love to travel, spend time outdoors, play board games, and spend time with friends and family.
