    <div class="about">
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Michigan with honors earning a B.S. in Computer Science with a sustainability minor in May 2024.
            I code because I love finding creative solutions to problems. I want to be able to help others and continue to grow my skillset. 
            What sets me apart is that I am very social and enjoy meeting new people. I want to utilize my other skills in my career, not
            just my coding abilites. I am looking for a forward or client facing software developer role. I am interested in Natural Language
            Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, AI, and website development. Click around to look at some projects I have done.
