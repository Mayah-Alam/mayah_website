    <div class="about">
        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Michigan with honors earning a B.S. in Computer Science with a sustainability minor in May 2024.
            I code because I love finding creative solutions to problems. I want to be able to help others and continue to grow my skillset. 
            What sets me apart is that I am very social and enjoy meeting new people. I want to utilize my other skills in my career, not
            just my coding abilites. Right now I am a math and computer science tutor at Varisty Tutors which allows me to combine my passions
            for people and tech. However, I am currently searching for a forward or client facing software developer role. I am especially 
            interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Artifical Intelligence (AI), and website development.
            I love to travel, spend time outdoors, play board games, and spend time with friends and family.
