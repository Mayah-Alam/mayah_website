        <h5>Plot Web Mobile App</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 4<br>
            When: January-April 2024<br>
            About: My team and I developed a <span class="key">mobile app</span> in our Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs class.
            Our app enables writers to visualize their character relationships in a story. We originally 
            planned on making an app where University Michigan students could check how busy the campus gyms
            are by equipment section. The school would not give us the data we needed so we <span class="key">had to pivot</span> half
            way through the semster. We made an MVP 1, conductued user testing, and made an MVP2. We managed 
            a database of characters and relationships between them using <span class="key">SQLite.</span> We also used a visual
            web to represent data that moved when a user touched it. Personally, <span class="key">I made custom clases in Flutter</span> to ensure visual 
            consistency throughout the app.  <br>

        <h5>Time Managment App</h5>
        <p>
            Team size: 2<br>
            When: 2019 <br>
            About: We made a time managment app using <span class="key">Swift</span> at the Neutral Zone in Ann Arbor, MI.
            I was currently learning Swift in a high school class while trying to make this app and my
            partner had to Swift knowledge. We never finished it but we had the chance to <span class="key">pitch our idea to local investors.</span>
            They liked the idea and thought I was a confident and well spoken presenter.<br>
